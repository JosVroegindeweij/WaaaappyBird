# TODOs

## Implement scoring
Increase score by 1 on every cleared obstacle.

## Show scoring in Game over screen
Show the achieved score in the game over screen. Probably show the high score.as well

## Implement clean dying animation
When dying, let player fall through the ground.

## Implement rotation for player model
Player sprite is currently always looking straight right. It would be cool if it rotates (looking at the place it will be going).

## Implement obstacle sprites
Obstacles are currently just the debug visuals. Need to find sprites for them and display those instead
